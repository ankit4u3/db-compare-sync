The purpose of this project is to create a **multi-platform** (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux) **multi-Database** (SQL Server, MySql, etc) comparison and synchronization tool comparable and better than presently available commercial product.

The hopes are that the tool will support major database engines:
  * SQL Server
  * SQLite
  * MySQL
  * Others?

There will be a very strong emphasis on quality via test driven development.

The project is being implemented in Java. Java's strong cross platform support makes it an ideal candidate for this project.
