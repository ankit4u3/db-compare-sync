# Quick Look - Status #

This project is a bit on hold. I've decided that I need to step back and really look at the architecture of the project. The base architecture is going to be extremely important before I continue to lay down code.

## Details ##

I've been given the opportunity to work on this project as part of a graduate class that I'm currently taking. I'm going to leverage this opportunity and use the class project to help design this project. This will not only provide feed back but allow some structure to be put around the overall design.

Coding is being halted; I believe that I need to stop thinking about the code and get the designs down.
