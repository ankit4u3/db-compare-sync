# Contributions #
I want to encourage as much outside contribution to
this project as possible. I hope for contributions to be easy and
straight forward. Aside from contributions, I need others to actually
join the project. So, if you are interested in become a regular developer
on this project, please review the code base and start making additions/contributions.

I'm not big in to politics so, as long as you contribute quality code towards
the overall goal of the project as outlined in the [Wiki](http://code.google.com/p/db-compare-sync/issues/list) and [Project Home](http://code.google.com/p/db-compare-sync/), you'll be good. If you have questions about anything, feel free to [create an issue](http://code.google.com/p/db-compare-sync/issues/list). I figure if there is a question about what to do or how to do, I've not properly documented my intentions.

Finally, keep in mind that the **quality of any contribution** is of great importance.


## Valid Contributions ##
Contributions should match the design and performance goals. The design goals
are laid out through code.google.com in the [Project Home](http://code.google.com/p/db-compare-sync/) and [Wiki Pages](http://code.google.com/p/db-compare-sync/issues/list). You may work on any unassigned task and submit any item once you feel it is completed.

The following are the contribution requirements

  1. Valid Unit Tests representing the requirement, feature or issue you are implementing
  1. Completed working feature
  1. Any misc. information required to merge the change
  1. The change should merge with the latest _stable_ tip (even if it's changed since you started) located at https://db-compare-sync.googlecode.com/hg/

## Beginning to Contribute ##
Once you complete your change, use Mercurial to generate a "bundle" against the latest
tip (remember, your change should merge against that tip) and leave the change
in code.google.com's issue tracker on the task or issue you've solved. If a task or issue doesn't exist, feel free to create an entry. Leave any notes or additional information needed in the issue. If your change needs to be
altered it is likely you will be asked to make the change. Who better to change
your code than you?

Please don't allow requests for changes to discourage you. Simply make the change and resubmit your new bundle.

Once your change has been received, it will be merged by a existing project commiter
or owner, tested and eventual sent to the _stable_ repository
(https://db-compare-sync.googlecode.com/hg/)
