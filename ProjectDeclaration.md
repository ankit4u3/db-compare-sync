# Project Declaration #

The purpose of this project is to create a multi-platform (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux) multi Database (SQL Server, MySql, etc) comparison and synchronization tool comparable and better than presently available commercial product.

The hopes are that the tool will support major database engines:
  * SQL Server
  * SQLite
  * MySQL
  * Others?

There will be a very strong emphasis on quality via test driven development.
